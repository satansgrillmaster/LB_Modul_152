# PC-Viewer
<br></br>
### This is the name of the project that we had to develop in this module 152. It's all about animations
### using javascript and for the special design, canvas.
<br></br>
## Description
<br></br>
### Our application shows a computer from the side view without the sidewall of it. On the starting page
### you can choose 3 different computer based on the slidebar button that you click on. After this there are
### options to click on the GPU, CPU or the SSD. If you choose the GPU it will redirect you to the detailed
### information page of the GPU with a bigger picture of it and the highlight the rotating ventilator.
### If you finished reading the details you can double click to return to the product.
<br></br>
### Because of the module 152 from ZLI we had to use javascript, html, css and json.
<br></br>
### It was a bit of a challenge to figure some function out. Our main challenge was the moving ventilator
### and the placement of it, because the 3 GPU are not the same size and the vent placement are different
### aswell. I guess for the future we could implement alot more of feature, like blinking lights on the RAM
### or maybe more moving vents on the product.
